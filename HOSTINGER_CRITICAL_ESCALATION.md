# 🚨 CRITICAL: HOSTINGER PARKED DOMAIN PERSISTENT ISSUE

## EMERGENCY STATUS: Standard fixes not working

Since basic troubleshooting hasn't resolved the parked domain issue, this indicates a **Hostinger server-level problem**.

## IMMEDIATE ESCALATION STEPS

### 1. 🔥 EMERGENCY HOSTINGER SUPPORT CONTACT

**Contact Hostinger Support IMMEDIATELY with this exact message:**

```
URGENT: Parked Domain Issue - Standard Fixes Not Working

Domain: [YOUR_DOMAIN]
Issue: Domain showing "parked domain" page instead of uploaded files
Duration: [HOW_LONG_THIS_HAS_BEEN_HAPPENING]

I have already completed ALL standard troubleshooting:
✓ Files uploaded to public_html directory
✓ Document root verified as public_html
✓ index.html test file uploaded (still shows parked domain)
✓ Cleared all caches multiple times
✓ Waited 48+ hours for DNS propagation
✓ Tried multiple browsers and devices
✓ Verified domain points to correct Hostinger account

REQUEST: Please check server-level configuration:
1. Verify domain DNS A-record points to correct server IP
2. Check for any server-level redirects or parking overrides
3. Verify hosting account is active and not suspended
4. Check if domain is properly linked to hosting space
5. Verify Apache virtual host configuration

This appears to be a server configuration issue, not a user file issue.
```

### 2. 🔍 ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSTIC CHECKS

#### A) Check Domain DNS Status
1. Go to: **whatsmydns.net**
2. Enter your domain
3. Check if A-record points to Hostinger's IP
4. Screenshot the results for support ticket

#### B) Check Hosting Account Status
1. **Hostinger Panel → Billing**
2. Verify account is active and paid
3. Check for any suspension notices

#### C) Verify Domain Connection
1. **Hostinger Panel → Domains**
2. Make sure your domain shows "Connected" status
3. Check if it's properly linked to your hosting plan

### 3. 📋 COMMON HOSTINGER SERVER ISSUES

#### Issue A: DNS Not Updated
**Symptoms:** Shows parked domain everywhere
**Cause:** Domain DNS still points to parking server
**Fix:** Hostinger must update DNS records manually

#### Issue B: Virtual Host Not Created  
**Symptoms:** Files uploaded but parked domain persists
**Cause:** Apache virtual host configuration missing
**Fix:** Hostinger technical team must create virtual host

#### Issue C: Account Migration Issues
**Symptoms:** Domain worked before, now shows parked
**Cause:** Server migration broke domain mapping
**Fix:** Hostinger must re-map domain to hosting space

#### Issue D: Caching at Server Level
**Symptoms:** Changes don't reflect despite clearing cache
**Cause:** Hostinger's edge caching not cleared
**Fix:** Hostinger must purge edge/CDN cache

### 4. 🆘 TEMPORARY WORKAROUNDS

#### Workaround A: Subdomain Test
1. **Create subdomain in Hostinger panel** (e.g., test.yourdomain.com)
2. **Point subdomain to public_html**
3. **Test if subdomain works**
4. If subdomain works, it confirms main domain DNS issue

#### Workaround B: Temporary Domain
1. **Check if Hostinger provided temporary URL**
2. **Format usually:** yourdomain.hostingertemp.com or similar
3. **Test Laravel on temporary URL**

#### Workaround C: IP Address Access
1. **Find your server IP in Hostinger panel**
2. **Try accessing:** http://[SERVER_IP]/
3. **If this works, it's definitely DNS issue**
