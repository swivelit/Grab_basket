## 🛠️ EMERGENCY WORKAROUNDS

### Workaround 1: Subdomain Test
**Purpose:** Prove hosting works, isolate domain issue

1. **Create subdomain** in Hostinger panel: `app.yourdomain.com`
2. **Point subdomain** to same public_html directory
3. **Test access**: If subdomain works, main domain DNS issue confirmed

### Workaround 2: Alternative Domain
**Purpose:** Get site online immediately

1. **Register temporary domain** (cheap .tk, .ml domains)
2. **Point to same Hostinger hosting**
3. **Use as temporary access** while main domain is fixed

### Workaround 3: Hostinger Temporary URL
**Purpose:** Direct server access

1. **Find temporary URL** in Hostinger panel
2. **Format usually**: `server123.hostinger.com/~username`
3. **Use for immediate access** to prove files work
